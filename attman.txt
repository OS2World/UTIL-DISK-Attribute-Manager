- The data displayed was not updated when changing folder
  or drive while the first file in the listbox was selected.
  Now it works fine.
- Better detection of attribute modification. Now it should
  avoid wrong "Some attribute has been modified" messages.
- File and EA size are now displayed together with last
  write, creation and last access date and time.
  To edit date and time click with mouse button1 with the
  Alt key pressed.
- Date and number format follows the national settings format,
  so it will display year/month/day, day/month/year or
  month/day/year and separate thousands by "," or "." etc.
  according to your national settings.
- All controls are resized according to the size of the
  font used by the main dialog. Width is based on the font
  average width so some kind of proportional (not monospaced)
  font will be displayed uncorrectly.
- All listbox can be resized and their width will be saved
  in attman.ini.
- Select previous/next file buttons added.
